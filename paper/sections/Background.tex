\subsection{Life Insurance Policies and Markov-models}\label{subsec:background:lifeinsurance}
A life insurance policy is a contract stating the obligations an insuring party has to an insured party in and transitioning between a finite set of states over many years.
Such states can include being alive and well (active), disabled, dead and more.
Transitions between states will have a certain probability, for example mortality rates for transitions between the active and dead state.
A state model such as this is also known as a continuous-time Markov-model which is used for both its expressiveness and its analyzability.

Figure \ref{fig:markovexample} shows an example of such a model with 3 states and 3 transitions between states. 
The labels between the states each have a $\mu$-function that states the probability of the transition occurring at time $t$. 
This is also known as the transition intensity.
Not all transition intensities will change over time while others such as mortality rate will.
For each change in time there may be associated costs whether there is a state transition or not.

\subsection{Thiele's differential equation and the Runge-Kutta Method}\label{subsec:background:thielerungekutta}
The goal of the computations performed in this thesis is to estimate the amount of money (reserve) required to be able to fulfil the obligations of a given life insurance plan.
Thiele's differential equation called ``the foundation of modern life insurance mathematics''\cite{bergermathematik} is a tool for determining conditional expected values in Markov models and it can be used to express a variety of life insurance policies.
The equation is expressed below in equation \ref{eq:thiele}. It assumes continuity for $V_s$, $b_s$, $\mu$ for every $t$ and consists of the following parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item $s$ is the current state
\item $V_s(t)$ is the reserve at time $t$ in state $s$
\item $r_s(t)$ is interest-rate at time $t$ in state $s$
\item $b_s(t)$ is the benefit paid by the insurer at time $t$ in state $s$
\item $T_s(t)$ is the possible transition-states from state $s$
\item $\mu_{s,ts}(t)$ is the transition intensity from state $s$ to state $ts$
\item $b_{s,ts}(t)$ is the transition cost from state $s$ to state $ts$
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}\label{eq:thiele}
\frac{d}{dt}V_s(t) = r_s(t) V_s(t) - b_s(t) - \sum_{ts \in T_{s}} \mu_{s,ts}(t) (V_{ts}(t) - V_s(t) + b_{s,ts})
\end{equation}

To shortly summarize it, the change in reserve at time $t$ in state $s$ is the current reserve times the interest-rate minus the benefit paid by the ensurer in the state minus the weighted transitioning costs to all linked states. 
The weighted transitioning cost to a state is the intensity of the transition (probability of the transition occurring) times the difference in reserves plus the transitioning cost.

With a differential equation such as this, one way to solve it is to approximate the result numerically using the Runge-Kutta method.
The Runge-Kutta method\cite{press2007numerical} is a method for integrating ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by using a trial step at the midpoint of an interval to cancel out lower-order error terms.
It works within boundaries set by a starting and end point. 
If the starting point is greater than the end point, the algorithm works backwards with negative step-sizes.
The basic implementation uses a fixed number of steps to reduce the inaccuracy of the method. 
By increasing the number of steps, the inaccuracy of the method is reduced at the cost of increased computational costs.
The most common step size seen in this project is 100 steps by advice of Peter Sestoft and by calculation specification definitions.
The fourth-order version of the Runge-Kutta method can be seen below in equation \ref{eq:rk4} approximating $y$ in the step from $t$ to $t+h$. It consists of the following parts:

\begin{itemize}
\item $h$ is the size of the step. With 100 steps, the step-size would be 0.01, or -0.01 if the start point is greater than the end point.
\item $f(t, e)$  is the right hand side of the given differential equation evaluated at time $t$ in environment $e$
\item $t$ is the initial time of the step
\item $y_t$ approximated result at time t
\item $O(h^5)$ represents the inaccuracy of the method
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}\label{eq:rk4}
&k_1 = h f(t, y_t)\\
&k_2 = h f(t + \frac{h}{2}, y_t + \frac{k_1}{2})\\
&k_3 = h f(t + \frac{h}{2}, y_t + \frac{k_2}{2})\\
&k_4 = h f(t + h, y_t + k_3)\\
&y_{n+1} = y_t + \frac{k_1}{6} + \frac{k_2}{3} + \frac{k_3}{3} + \frac{k_4}{6} + O(h^5)
\end{aligned}\end{equation}

\subsection{Parallelization and the GPU}\label{subsec:background:parallelization}
Parallelization is the act of taking one large task and splitting it into smaller tasks that run concurrently (``in parallel'').
This could for example be cooking 10 different pies, where rather than using 1 baker you now use 10 bakers creating 10 pies at the speed of one.
Algorithmically this could be an algorithm that initially does some computation that loops $n$ times where each iteration is independent and takes $w$ time to complete, but is altered to instead utilize $n$ tasks that each execute one iteration worth of work.
Instead of taking $w \cdot n$ time to complete, it can now be done in just $w$ time plus whatever overhead is associated with creating the tasks and dividing the work.
This is reliant on each iteration being independent, as if the iterations are dependent on each other then it can not be executed before the previous iteration completes.
To continue the pie example, if one baker is assigned to make all the pie-crusts, no pie will be baked before this tasks is done.
Loops are not the only thing that can be parallelized and all independent tasks can to some extend be parallelized. 
With various synchronization techniques, partially dependent calculations can also harness the power of parallelization, though at the risk of increased complexity and errors such as deadlocks.
As only independent computation parallelization is utilized, other forms will not be discussed further.

In computing, parallelization utilizing constructs such as processes and threads can be performed on multi-core CPUs, but can especially be used by GPUs that were designed for compute-intensive and highly parallel computations, precisely what graphics rendering is about.
This is because unlike the CPU which is a general-purpose machine with a focus on data-caching and flow control, the GPU is specialized for high arithmetic processing with more transistors dedicated to data processing as illustrated in green by figure \ref{cpugpu}. 
The figure contains Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU's, in green) responsible for logical operations and integer arithmetic, Control Units (in yellow) responsible for communication and coordination between input/output devices and various memory units (in orange) such as a memory cache and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).

\end{figure}

\subsection{The CUDA platform and CUDA C}\label{subsec:background:cudac}
CUDA is NVIDIAs parallel computing platform and programming model for the GPU.
It is available on multiple platforms but does require an NVIDIA graphics card. 
A particular NVIDIA graphics card will have a certain Compute Capability (CC) that determines availability of certain attributes and features.

The CUDA platform consists of the CUDA C and C++ language (referred to as CUDA C from this point), based on the C and C++ languages but with some alterations.
It also has parallel computing extensions for other languages such as Fortran and Python.
The CUDA Toolkit is also a part of the platform, consisting of a compiler, math libraries and tools for debugging and optimizing performance as well as guides, user manuals, API references and other documentation.

\subsubsection{CUDA Architecture}
The CUDA model is build around a hierarichal architecture of the GPU. 
At the top of the architecture is the streaming multi-processor (SM) of which a GPU can have many. 
Each SM consists of multiple CUDA cores that are used to concurrently execute a group of 32 threads known as a warp. 
As the SM executes the instructions in terms of warps, the total number of threads in a block should be a multiple of the warp-size for maximum efficiency.
Each SM executes one group of threads that have access to a shared memory-space.
This group of threads, which ideally should be a multiple of warps, is called a block. 
An example overview of the architecture can be seen in figure \ref{cuda_architecture}.
As each SM executes blocks sequentially, more SMs available to the GPU will increase the possible parallelization and speed up the execution of the total amount of blocks. 
Assuming that blocks will generally finish at the same time, this also means that the amount of blocks should be a multiple of the amount of multiprocessors for maximum efficiency.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{cuda_architecture.jpg}
\caption{The CUDA SM/block architecture. From the CUDA C Programming Guide, page 7 \cite{nvidia2014programming}\label{cuda_architecture}}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Thread Hierarchy}
Blocks can be organized in a grid of multiple dimensions (up to 3 on the latest version of NVIDIA cards). 
The same applies to the threads within a block.
An example of can be seen in figure \ref{thread_distribution}.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{thread_distribution.jpg}
\caption{The CUDA thread hierarchy. From the CUDA C Programming Guide, page 11 \cite{nvidia2014programming}\label{thread_distribution}}
\end{figure}

As this project only utilizes 1-dimensional grids and blocks, the resulting thread hierarchy is a two-dimensional matrix. 
An example with the unique thread-IDs can be seen in figure \ref{thread_hierarchy}.

\begin{figure}[h!]\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{thread_hierarchy.jpg}
\caption{CUDA thread hierarchy with 1-dimensional blocks and threads.\label{thread_hierarchy}}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Memory model}
A thread has access to various types of memory.
There is \emph{local} memory only available to the thread itself.
This is facilitated by 32KiB per block of fast registers while available and falling back on relatively slow local memory afterwards (stored in global memory but only accessed by the thread).

Beyond that, it has access to low-latency \emph{shared} on-chip memory physically residing on the GPU that is available to all threads in the same block. 
Because of these properties, shared memory can be used for communication between threads or as a software managed cache.

The thread also has access to \emph{global} off-chip memory accessible to all threads in all blocks.
This has a higher latency, but caching can alleviate some of this.

There is also 64KB of immutable cached \emph{constant} memory which can be an alternative to unchanging global memory.
It is especially fast when all threads in the warp need to read the same memory location.
Constant memory will often be faster than global memory due to a higher likelihood of being cached on-chip, but the fact it is immutable and of a fixed size limits its applicability.
Another immutable memory type is \emph{texture} memory which can be used for various purposes, but is ideally used for algorithms with memory access patterns where threads are likely to read from an address that is 2-dimension-spatially local (such as computer graphic shaders).

Data loaded from local or global memory is cached in the on-chip \emph{L1} cache for each SM and a shared \emph{L2} cache for all SMs.
The L1 cache will typically contain up to 16KB of data, but this limit can be increased up to 48KB by by sacrificing shared memory.
The L2 cache will on newer graphics cards contain up to 768KB of data.

A summary of the properties of the various memory types can be seen in table \ref{table:memorytypes}.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c | c | }
  \hline
           & Read-only & On-chip   & Cached & Scope  \\ \hline
  Register & No        & Yes       & No     & Thread \\ \hline
  Local    & No        & No        & Yes    & Thread \\ \hline
  Shared   & No        & Yes       & No     & Block  \\ \hline
  Global   & No        & No        & Yes    & Kernel \\ \hline
  Texture  & Yes       & No        & Yes    & Kernel \\ \hline
  Constant & Yes       & No        & Yes    & Kernel \\ \hline
  L1 Cache & No        & Yes       & N/A    & N/A    \\ \hline
  L2 Cache & No        & No        & N/A    & N/A    \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Properties of CUDA memory types\label{table:memorytypes}}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{CUDA C}
CUDA C is based on C with added declaration specifiers for methods and variables. 
The most essential declaration specifier is the \textbf{\_\_global\_\_} specifier which declares a method to be a \textbf{kernel}. 
Kernels are void-methods that are callable from the CPU but executed on the GPU. 
Code sample \ref{cuda_add} shows a simple kernel performing vector addition of the vectors $a$ and $b$ of size $N$.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption=CUDA C addition kernel, label=cuda_add]
__global__ void Add(float* a, float* b, float* result){
	//unique id within the kernel
	int i = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
	// (blockIdx always 0 in this example)
	result[i] = a[i] + b[i];
}

int main(){
	...Initiate memory on host and device
	Add<<<1, N>>>(a, b, result); //invoke kernel on 1 block of N threads
	...Copy back and use result, free memory as appropriate
}
\end{lstlisting}

One thing to note is the kernel launch-parameters of Add-method in $main$ which specify the number of blocks and the number of threads per block on which the kernel should be executed. 

CUDA C also has other declaration specifiers. 
The \textbf{\_\_device\_\_} specifier indicates that a method will only be compiled for the GPU (which can be referenced by kernels), the \textbf{\_\_host\_\_} specifier indicates that a method will be available for the CPU.
These two specifiers can also be used together for compilation to both platforms.
Variables have the \textbf{\_\_device\_\_} specifier, as well as the \textbf{\_\_constant\_\_} specifier to indicate that they are to be stored in constant memory or the \textbf{\_\_shared\_\_} specifier for shared memory.

As it is based on C, dynamic memory must be allocated using $malloc$ and subsequently de-allocated by $free$.
This operation also has to be done for the device memory using the equivalent $cudaMalloc$ and $cudaFree$.
One of the many benefits of using a modern language is avoiding tedious memory management like this, but at the cost of control that could potentially decrease performance.

\subsection{F\# and Code Quotations}\label{subsec:background:codequotations}
F\#\cite{fsharp} is an open source, cross-platform functional programming language originating from Microsoft that runs on the .NET platform.
Code quotations is a language feature of F\# that allows one to dynamically generate abstract syntax trees from F\# expressions. 
It is used in particular to transform F\# to other languages such as SQL automatically. 
It can also be used to generate F\# code that can be evaluated. 
Code quotations support both typed and untyped expressions using \emph{\textless @ ... @\textgreater} and \emph{\textless @@ ... @@\textgreater} respectively. 

For example, the expression \emph{\textless @ let plusfive number = number + 5 in plusfive @\textgreater} is automatically translated into the abstract syntax tree in figure \ref{quotationast}. 
As quotations only support expressions, a let declaration can not exist on its own, hence returning the function at the end (in the $in$ part of the quotation).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Abstract syntax tree for the example quotation expression, label=quotationast]
Let (plusfive, 
	Lambda (number, 
		Call (None, op_Addition, [number, Value (5)])
	), 
	plusfive)
\end{lstlisting}

Code quotations also allow for the mixing of quotation expressions using the splicing operators $\%$ for typed and $\%\%$ for untyped expressions as can be seen in code sample \ref{quotationsmixin}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Quotation mixing, label=quotationsmixin]
let plusfive = <@ let plusfive number = number + 5 in plusfive @>
//Has type Expr<int->int>
let plus10 = <@ let plusten number = number |> %plusfive |> %plusfive in plusten @>
//Also has type Expr<int->int>
let untypedplus10 = <@@ %plus10 @@>
//Has type Expr
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{F\# and Alea.cuBase}\label{subsec:background:fsharpcubase}
Alea.cuBase by QuantAlea\cite{quantalea} is a commercial language-integrated compiler for F\# that allows for CUDA development on the .NET platform.
By relying on run-time code-generation it allows for extremely extensible kernels to an extent not easily possible in CUDA C.

It utilizes F\#'s meta-programming support Code Quotations for automatic run-time generation of abstract syntax-trees that are then compiled into CUDA's Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Parallel Thread Execution (PTX) code using Alea.cuBase's compilation API.
Code sample \ref{cubase_add} shows what a simple vector squaring-kernel could look like in F\# using Alea.cuBase.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Alea.cuBase square kernel, label=cubase_add]
let Square = cuda { //use the Alea.cuBase cuda workflow
  let! kernel = <@ fun (a:deviceptr<int>) (result:deviceptr<int>) ->
      let i = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x
      result.[i] <- a.[i] * a.[i] @> |> Compiler.DefineKernel
  return Entry(fun program ->
    let worker = program.Worker
    let kernel = program.Apply kernel
    //return host-execution method
    fun (a:int[]) ->
      use a = worker.Malloc(a)
      use result = worker.Malloc(Array.zeroCreate a.Length)
      kernel.Launch (LaunchParam(1, a.Length)) a.Ptr result.Ptr
      result.Gather()) //return result
}
[<EntryPoint>]
let main argv = 
  let a = [| for i in 1 .. 10 -> i |]
  use program = Square |> Compiler.load Worker.Default
  program.Run a |> Array.iter (fun e -> printfn "%d" e)
  0 //return 0 to indicate success
\end{lstlisting}

The $cuda$ workflow/computation expression (or ``monad'' for the so inclined) contains the kernel defined in a code quotations and compiled to an actual kernel, and it returns a host-side execution method that will handle allocation and de-allocation of device-side memory. 
As we are using F\#, the deallocation is handled automatically by using the $use$-keyword that automatically frees up resources once the variables referencing them are out of scope. 
The kernel is loaded to a worker (a CUDA context and background-thread) in the main method compiling the PTX code to NVIDIA internal ISA code. %explain better
Following this, the compiled kernel is run using the parameters defined in the run-time method of the $cuda$ workflow (in this case, just an integer array) and the result is returned to the CPU where it can be processed. 
In this example is it simply printed to the console. 

\subsection{Actulus Calculation Specification language}\label{subsec:background:calcspec}
The Actulus Calculation Specification language (CalcSpec) is a domain-specific language for defining the differential equations that make up an insurance plan.
The main purpose of the language is to define various coefficient used in the Markov-model defining the life insurance policy.
The overall structure of the language can be seen in code sample \ref{calcspecstructure}.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=CalcSpec structure, label=calcspecstructure]
calculation = {
    name = <Name of calculation>,
    algorithm = { <Algorithm> },
    equations = { <Equations> },
    range = { <Range> },
    [output = "[" <Output> "]",]
    boundaryvalues = { <Boundary values> },
    expressions = { <Expressions> }
  }
\end{lstlisting}

An explanation of each element follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textless Algorithm\textgreater{} will include the name of the algorithm (for example ``Runge Kutta 4'') and the parameters (for example the step-size for Runge Kutta 4) for the algorithm.
\item The \textless Equations\textgreater{}  describes the differential equations used by the algorithm. This is typically done by referencing functions defined in \textless{}Expressions\textgreater{}. Every component of the differential equation must describe the coefficients of the component. If coefficients are 0, they can also be described as constants (for example 0) or as an empty blocks for multi-part coefficients.
\item The \textless{}Range\textgreater{} and \textless{}Boundary values\textgreater{} are related to the differential equation described in \textless{}Equations\textgreater{} and describes the interval in which the algorithm should solve the equation subject to the boundary conditions.
\item \textless{}Output\textgreater{} is an optional declaration that specifies which parts of the calculations that should be returned. It is currently not supported in this project. %Update if added
\item \textless{}Expressions\textgreater{} is where constants and function are defined. Functions can only take one parameter but can reference other constants and variables.
\end{itemize}

An example of the pure endowment insurance plan can be seen in code sample \ref{pe_calcspec}. 
Note that it utilizes the Dirac $delta$ function\cite{hassani2009dirac} which is used to express a discontinuity point in which a lump sum is to be paid.%confirm this isn't bullshit


\begin{lstlisting}[caption=The pure endowment insurance plan expressed in CalcSpec, label=pe_calcspec]

    equations = { 
        0 = { r_j = r, b_j = b0, mu_jk = { 1 = GM }, b_jk = { } },
        1 = { },
    },
    range = { from = 40, to = 0 },
    boundaryvalues = { 0 = 0 , 1 = 0 },
    expressions = {
        interestrate = 0.05,
        bpension = 1,
        pensiontime = 35,
        age = 30,
        r(t) = interestrate,
        b0(t) = bpension * delta(t - pensiontime),
        GM(t) = 0.0005 + 10 ^ (5.728 - 10 + 0.038*(age + t))
    }
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Hardware}\label{subsec:background:hardware}
As the intended audience for this particular application of parallelization is fairly limited and can be expected to afford specific hardware, it has not been a concern that specific hardware may be required to run it.
That being said, the minimal requirement to run the program is only an NVIDIA GPU of at least compute capability 2.0 as it is the minimal requirement to use Alea.cuBase (and use double-precision floats).
The code was only tested on the NVIDIA Tesla C2075 GPU which has the following properties (see appendix \ref{app:deviceQuery} for full results of running NVIDIA's deviceQuery tool):

\begin{itemize}
\item Compute capability: 2.0
\item Multiprocessors: 14
\item CUDA cores per Multiprocessor: 32
\item GPU Clock rate: 1147 MHz (1.15 GHz)
\item Memory clock rate: 1566 MHz
\item Total global memory: 4.096GB
\item Total constant memory: 64KB
\item Total shared memory per block: 48KB
\item Total amount of registers per block: 32768
\item Total amount of threads per multiprocessor: 1536
\item Total amount of threads per block: 1024
\item L2 Cache Size: 768KB
\item Run time limit on kernels: No
\end{itemize}

The CPU is a 2.53GHz Intel Xeion W3505 and the system has 4GB ram.
