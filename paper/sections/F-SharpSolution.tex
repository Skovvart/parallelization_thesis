\subsection{F\# Alea.cuBase Solution}
Describe implemented F\# Alea.cuBase solution

\subsection{User and insurance plan parameters}
Talk about how running the same thing over and over again is not a very good idea, and how user and pension plan parameters are handled and their effect on performance.

Changed the dV, bj\_ii and RK4\_n signatures to include params array, setting old constants to variable number.
