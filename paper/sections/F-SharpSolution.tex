\subsection{F\# Alea.cuBase Solution}
Describe implemented F\# Alea.cuBase solution

Talk about kernel generation time + memory copying

other todo: 
	Add RK4\_n step-image like other reports? 
	show visual abstract syntax tree? 
	write more about delta-function (how it's not relevant)



\subsection{Insurance plan parameters}
Talk about how running the same thing over and over again is not a very good idea, and how user and pension plan parameters are handled and their effect on performance.

Changed the dV, bj\_ii and RK4\_n signatures to include params array, setting old constants to variable number.

Talk about parameter generation and division of work (or wait until calcspec? dunno)
